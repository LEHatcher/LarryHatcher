    <p class="center-link">Moving on.  Today, on my webpage, I replace my Regression Project with a Flask REST API project.  This seem a little 
	                   more into what I am currently in to.  Working and learning APIs, JSON, CRUD, working with programs such as Thunder 
	                   Client and Postman.  Good stuff.  Of course the Regression Project contain a lot of good stuff.  Setting up and 
	                   using a complex Excel model to do linear and logistic regression.  Also you can't beat the basic statistical analysis done.  
	                   It's always good to review that from time to time.

    <p class="center-link">Summer is here.  I'm still studying Python.  I spend about 2 hours a day with it.  
                           Some days I feel like I've really learned something, other days, not so much.
                           Lately I have been focusing on working with APIs.  The information I picked up about
                           working with pip and venv was very exciting.  I also want to start learning JavaScript.
                           That will be my next new thing.  Just today I started a refresher course on ML statistics.
                           I always need more math!</p>
                           
    <p class="center-link">I need to get out of the house and do more physical activity.  I've got an eight mile bike course 
	                   laid out that I need to do, al least, twice a week.  Anything to build up a sweat.  BTW
	                   I am a big Stephen King fan.  I'm in the middle of his latest book, Never Flinch".

    <p class="center-link">I just finished looking at some very cool APIs.  Between seeing all of this 
                           data and trying to master Postman, I'm begining to realize just how powerful a 
                           knowledge of APIs can be.  Knowledge and data is the key to everything.</p>
                           
    <p class="center-link">Summer is almost here.  I haven't dragged my bicycle out yet but it's definitely 
                           time.  Also, and this is big news, it is now less than a 100 days until the Dawgs 
                           kick off the season against Marshall on August 30th between the hedges. I would also be 
                           amiss not to mention that the Lady Dawgs just won the National Championship in tennis!

    <p class="center-link">I'm excited with the launch of my new website.  I want to show
                           prespective employers some of my talents, creativity, and vision.  
                           I hope this site achieves that but I think my motives are a little more personal.
                           I want to see how far I can push myself and what I can create.

    <p class="center-link">I'm trying to try to keep this blog a mixture of personal and professional introspection.
                           Today I just want to mention where I'm at and what I am doing.  The thing that 
                           dominates most of my time now is Python.  This week I spent time with decorators in Python and the various 
                           ways to use them.  Also, I working on learning APIs and Postman.  That is new to me and, so far, it's been
                           been a challenge.  Of course I always try to stay current with Tableau and SQL.</p>
    <p class="center-link">Just on a personal note:  I can't do anything without the help of the Data Dawgs; Chancellor on the left and Miss Anne on the right.
                           They keep me grounded and help me stay focused.  </p>
